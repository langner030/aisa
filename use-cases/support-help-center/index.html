    <h1>Support & Help Center</h1>
    <p>Improve self-service and ticket deflection with intent-aware search.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Enhance self-service capabilities and reduce ticket volumes by implementing intent-aware search.</li>
        <li>Boost customer satisfaction and operational efficiency through targeted support solutions.</li>
        <li>Optimize search results to provide accurate and relevant information, improving user experience.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>What it is</h2>
    <p>Intent-aware search is a sophisticated search technology that understands user intent and context to deliver highly relevant search results. It goes beyond traditional keyword-based search to provide users with accurate answers to their queries.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Why it matters</h2>
    <p>Implementing intent-aware search in a support and help center can have a significant impact on business outcomes. Key performance indicators (KPIs) such as customer satisfaction, ticket deflection rates, and operational efficiency can be greatly improved.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>How it works</h2>
    <p>The architecture of intent-aware search involves advanced algorithms that analyze user queries, understand user intent, and match it with relevant content in the knowledge base. Key concepts include natural language processing, machine learning, and semantic search.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Implementation Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Assess current search capabilities and user needs.</li>
        <li>Select a suitable intent-aware search solution.</li>
        <li>Integrate the solution with the existing support and help center platform.</li>
        <li>Train the system with relevant data and continuously optimize search results.</li>
    </ol>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Common Pitfalls & Trade-offs</h2>
    <p>Common pitfalls include inadequate data quality, misaligned user intent modeling, and lack of continuous optimization. Trade-offs may involve balancing search accuracy with computational resources and implementation costs.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Measurement</h2>
    <p>Key metrics for evaluating intent-aware search performance include Click-Through Rate (CTR), Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG), Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), and zero-results rate. These metrics help in assessing the relevance and effectiveness of search results.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Mini Case Example</h2>
    <p>In a support and help center for a software company, implementing intent-aware search led to a 20% reduction in ticket volumes, a 15% increase in customer satisfaction scores, and a 25% improvement in operational efficiency within the first six months of deployment.</p>

    <h2>FAQ</h2>
    <h3>How does intent-aware search differ from traditional keyword-based search?</h3>
    <p>Intent-aware search understands user intent and context to provide more accurate and relevant search results compared to keyword-based search.</p>
    
    <h3>What are the common challenges in implementing intent-aware search?</h3>
    <p>Common challenges include data quality issues, user intent misinterpretation, and the need for continuous optimization to maintain search relevance.</p>
    
    <h3>How can businesses measure the success of intent-aware search implementation?</h3>
    <p>Businesses can measure success through metrics like Click-Through Rate (CTR), Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG), Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), and zero-results rate to evaluate search performance.</p>
